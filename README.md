Google App Engine(GAE) Support package for Laravel 5.1.

Currently supported features:
- Generation of general configuration files
- Mail service provider
- Queue service provider
- Database connection
- Filesystem

For Lumen see https://github.com/shpasser/GaeSupportLumen.

## Installation

Pull in the package via Composer.

```js
"require": {
    "shpasser/gae-support-l5": "~1.0"
}
```

Then include the service provider within `config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    Shpasser\GaeSupportL5\GaeSupportServiceProvider::class
];
```

## Usage

Generate the GAE related files/entries.

Command template:
```bash
php artisan gae:setup --config --cache-config --bucket="your-bucket-id" --db-socket="cloud-sql-instance-socket-connection-string" --db-name="cloud-sql-database-name" --db-host="cloud-sql-instance-ipv4-address" app-id
```

Arguments and Options:
<pre>
php artisan gae:setup [options] [--] app-id

Arguments:
  app-id                     GAE application ID.

Options:
      --config               Generate "app.yaml" and "php.ini" config files.
      --cache-config         Generate cached Laravel config file for use on Google App Engine.
      --bucket=BUCKET        Use the specified GCS-bucket instead of the default one.
      --db-socket=DB-SOCKET  Cloud SQL socket connection string for production environment.
      --db-name=DB-NAME      Cloud SQL database name.
      --db-host=DB-HOST      Cloud SQL database host IPv4 address for local environment.
</pre>

`--cache-config` option generates cached config file for GAE. This option is essential, because cached config file generated by `php artisan config:cache` is not suitable for use on GAE. As well, cached config file generated for GAE probably will not work in local environment. This option should be used to generate cached config file before application is deployed on GAE.

`--bucket` option defines the GCS-bucket ID to be used by the application for storage. Default GCS bucket is configured unless the option is used.

When `--db-name` option is defined at least one of `--db-socket` or `--db-host` should
be also defined.

`--db-socket` is set using the following format: `/cloudsql/<app-id>:<cloud-sql-instance-name>`. Where `<cloud-sql-instance-name>` is the Cloud SQL instance name and `<app-id>` is the name of the application it belongs to.

### Mail

The mail driver configuration can be found in `config/mail.php` and `.env.production`,
these configuration files are modified / generated by the artisan command. There is
no need in any kind of custom configuration. All the outgoing mail messages are sent
with sender address of an administrator of the application, i.e. `admin@your-app-id.appspotmail.com`.
The `sender`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `replyTo`, `subject`, `body` and `attachment`
parts of email message are supported.

### Queues

The modified queue configuration file `config/queue.php` should contain:

```php
return array(

	...

	/*
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| GAE Queue Connection
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	*/

	'connections' => array(

		'gae' => array(
			'driver'	=> 'gae',
			'queue'		=> 'default',
			'url'		=> '/tasks',
			'encrypt'	=> true,
		),

		...

	),

);
```

The 'default' queue and encryption are used by default.
In order to use the queue your `app/Http/routes.php` file should contain the following route:

```php
Route::post('tasks', array('as' => 'tasks',
function()
{
	return Queue::marshal();
}));
```

This route will be used by the GAE queue to push the jobs. Please notice that the route
and the GAE Queue Connection 'url' parameter point to the same URL. Since the requests
submitted using the route are issued by GAE itself it cannot be CSRF-protected.
For more information on the matter please see http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/queues#push-queues.

### Cache, Session and Log

Cache, Session and Log components are supported via the use of specific drivers / handlers:

- Cache     - using the 'memcached' driver,
- Session   - using the 'memcached' driver,
- Log       - using 'syslog' handler.

The configuration options for the mentioned drivers / handlers are generated by the artisan command
and can be found in `.env.production` configuration file.

### Database

Google Cloud SQL is supported via Laravel's MySql driver. The connection configuration is added by
the artisan command to `config/database.php` under `cloudsql`. The connection parameters can be
configured using `--db-socket`, `--db-name` and `--db-host` options via the artisan command.

The database related environment variables are set in `.env.production` and `.env.local` files.

The `production` environment is configured to use the socket connection while the `local` configured
to connect via the IPv4 address of the Google Cloud SQL instance. Use Google Developers Console in
order to obtain the socket connection string and enable the IPv4 address of your database instance.

The migrations are supported while working in `local` environment only.

To use either the `production` or the `local` environment rename the appropriate file to `.env`.

### Filesystem

In order to support Laravel filesystem on GAE the artisan command modifies `config/filesystem.php`
to include an additional disk:

```php
'gae' => [
    'driver' => 'gae',
    'root'   => storage_path().'/app',
],
```

and adds the following line to `.env.production` file:

```php
FILESYSTEM = gae
```

### Optimizations

The initialization of GSC bucket can be skipped to boost the performance.
In order to do so, set the following option in the `app.yaml` file:
```yaml
env_variables:
        GAE_SKIP_GCS_INIT: true
```
the storage path will be set to `/storage` directory of the GCS bucket and storage
directory structure creation will be skipped.

If not used the filesystem initialization can be removed to minimize GCS usage. In order to
do so, remove the following line from `.env.production` file:

```php
FILESYSTEM = gae
```

### Artisan Console for GAE

To support `artisan` commands while running on GAE the package provides `Artisan Console for GAE`.
The console is implemented as a separate service and not enabled by default for security reasons. To use the console securely `/artisan` route has to be protected.

#### Installation

Include the service provider within `config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    Shpasser\GaeSupportL5\GaeArtisanConsoleServiceProvider::class
];
```

Add `/artisan` URL handler to `app.yaml` file.

```yaml
handlers:

        - url: /artisan
          script: public/index.php
          login: admin
          secure: always

        - url: /.*
          script: public/index.php

```

`/artisan` URL handler has to appear before the last one (`url: /.*`), otherwise it will be ignored by GAE.
The suggested handler secures the route using GAE URL security options. For more information see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/config/appconfig#PHP_app_yaml_Secure_URLs.

#### Usage

Enter URL http://your-app-id.appspot.com/artisan in your browser and use the displayed form to submit `artisan` commands.
Since GAE's filesystem is read-only the commands will not be able to perform write / update operations on it. For the same reason migrations have to be prepared on local development environment before the deployment takes place. Since the console is not really interactive all the commands are executed in non-interactive mode(by automatic appending of `-n` option).

## Deployment

Backup the existing `.env` file if needed and rename the generated `.env.production` to `.env`
before deploying your app.

Download and install GAE SDK for PHP and deploy your app.

## Known Issues

As of now Laravel scheduled commands are not supported while running on GAE.
In order to use `Artisan Console for GAE` the application class `app/Console/Kernel`
has be edited and any of the commands scheduled using its `schedule()` function should be removed.
